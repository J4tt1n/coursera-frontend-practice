# Coursera Frontend Course
I have taken a course from Coursera whose name is 'HTML, CSS and JavaScript for Web Developers' by John Hopkins University.
This course taught about the basics of HTML, CSS and JS and how they work and how they be used to make websites and applications.

The repository consists of all modules and exercises that were given to me in the course.
